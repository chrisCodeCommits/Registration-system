# About Pets Adopt Clinic 
Pet Adopt Clinic is a fictitious brand created by me, solely for the purpose of showcasing my python/Django programing skill. All products and people associated with Pet Adopt Clinic are also fictitious. Any resemblance to real brands, products, or people is purely coincidental. Please see your veterinarian for all matters related to your pet's health.
